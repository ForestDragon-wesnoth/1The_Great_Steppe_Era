    description= _ "Tarbynns are horrible creations of the Bull God from the underworld. Herds of these skeletal creatures graze in his dark realm, and the largest and strongest of them are his bodyguards. Taking steppe ogres under his protection, the Bull God revealed to them the secret of summoning tarbynns into the world of the living. Squads of these demons became a formidable force which priests use to combat both foreign enemies and internal rivals, shamans. The lowest and weakest kind of tarbynns are observers. They are summoned most often, so the word "tarbynn" means lesser demons in the first place (more powerful kinds have their own established names). To summon an observer, priests fill a pot with bull's blood, throw a skull and cast the spell. If everything is done properly, the skull comes to live and a semi-sentient hungry beast with burning eyes arises from the pot. Streams of blood circle around its head and serve as its fuel. To maintain its existence, a tarbynn must constantly replenish his blood supply, so hunger is the only feeling it knows.
Even lesser of tarbynns have access to terrible blood magic, with their gaze they can literally draw the red liquid from their victim's body and fill their aura with it. Though actually, the main purpose of observers is not combat; they are summoned to watch out for enemies or suspicious allies. Dozens of these flying skulls patrol neighbourhoods of priests in steppe settlements, they also accompany ogres' armies in large campaigns. Ordinary ogres don't like to be watched by hungry demons-skulls, that's why they treat priests with resentment and hidden fear."

    description= _ "Abomination are powerful monsters from the underworld. They were named so because no other word can truly describe these imposing and bloodthirsty creatures. The summoning of an Abomination is an monumental event for the steppe horde. To summon this beast, shamans shed rivers of blood, hundreds of bull bones fill a giant cauldron, and dozens of strong and furious ogres are sacrificed. All of this because the lord of the underworld himself is watching this: without the personal permission of the Bull God, the summoning will not work, so he needs to be offered generous gifts. As a result of bloody spells and terrible rituals, which can last for several days, from the black cauldron, which in such cases is called the Bloody Gate, a giant bone monstrosity with hungry burning eyes is born, which is soaked in blood, and which craves for more of the red liquid every second of its existence. As soon as possible, the Abomination is sent into battle. None of the sedentary peoples who met the Nightmare in battle could return and convey the horror it instills in their opponents. And the ogres themselves try to forget battles side-by-side with the Abomination, like a bad dream. Imagine for yourself: a giant bone beast rushes over the battlefield and collects a bloody harvest: under its piercing howl, like the howl of the wind in a hurricane, whole squads of friends and enemies alike fall to the ground at once, their blood boils, ruptures blood vessels and from under the skin flies in red streams into the ribs of the monster. And those who tried to stop the Nightmare in close combat are torn to pieces by huge claws or are crushed by its ominous skull. Where the Abomination flew by, a trail of dry and shriveled corpses and pieces of bodies remains, while not a drop of blood is left either in the dead or on the ground. Stopping such undead and sending them to another world after the war is as important an event as the summoning. Once again, rivers of blood, more sacrifices, sacrifices, and sacrifices, and all for the sake of the subterranean ruler personally taking his foul creation from this world. Throughout the history of the ogres, the Abominations have been called only a few times, but each of these calls is firmly imprinted in the memory of generations. So the ogres developed a fear of bull priests, and their neighbors have chilling legends about bloody demons from the depths of the steppes, which at any moment can wake up again and cause another apocalypse."
