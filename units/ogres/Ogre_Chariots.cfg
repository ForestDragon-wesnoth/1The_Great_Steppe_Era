    description= _ "By their nature, ogres are nomads, but as you know, you can't go far on foot in the steppe. Not a single ridable animal can withstand an adult ogre, so these steppe dwellers travel on impressive chariots drawn by bulls. Dozens of workshops in the city camps work to provide the hordes with these vehicles. Of course, ogre chariots are not as fast and skillful as the mechanisms of other peoples, but the simplicity, size and strength make up for the lack of speed. Ogres roam in chariots on their own, on them they transport their homes and all goods. And for battle, they use lightweight two-wheeled structures. True, their effectiveness is not very high, but the roar and crackling that they create can horrify the weak-minded creatures, and the frontal ram can break the formation of light infantry."

Such chariots are decorated with horns and shields, driven by the strongest and fiercest bull, and fearsome scythes are attached to their wheels. And if ordinary war chariots used by other races mow people down on the legs and stomachs, then the huge chariots of ogres literally cut off the heads of the enemies! In battle, these contraptions emit a terrible roar and are a terrifying sight to anyone unlucky enough to encounter them."
