Tumenbashi constitute the highest circle of government of the country, below only the great Khagan himself. And since the hierarchy of the snakeheads is reflected in the higher power of the magical aura, relative to the tarhan aristocrats - the Tumenbashi are even more dangerous mages with excellent abilities to hypnotize their foes into submission and an increased ability to control the Black Flame. Subduing some of the enemies, and burning others - that is what happens when these beings appear on the battlefield."

Through a series of complex procedures, the body of the mummy literally freezes in time, impervious to decay and parasites hungry for dead flesh, then is reanimated with same dark magic that spawned the Nuckelavee. Deceivers of death - Immortals - are warriors merciless and brutal in battle, that shower enemies with sabers held by their cold, tireless grip."
