    description=_"The ogre religion, which takes its roots from the teachings of white mages from the Kingdom of Wesnoth, aims to slay monsters and vile spirits, with which the soul of a noble slayer is cleansed. In order to maintain and spread the idea of ​​'cleansing the fire of the soul', Ogres created a clergy estate, perhaps much more complexly organized than in the realm of Humans.
Clerics are just the first step in the spiritual hierarchy. They serve in temples and monasteries, as well as - as befits any ogre - on the battlefield, where they strike heretics with streams of light and knock out their teeth with heavy blows."

Bishops are engaged in general control over the conduct within the spiritual organization: the observance of rituals, the service of lower ranks, the collection of taxes. Beginning at this stage, priests receive a crude staff to help them direct the cleansing light as well as tap on the tops of dissenters."

As in the case of the King of Ogres, the title of the Ogre Pope is hereditary, therefore, as with the royal knightly retinue, it is the duty of the cardinals to protect the higher person from competition in the succession of the throne. Although they do not wield sharp spears or swords, they have ruthless fire in their hands, which they will not hesitate to use against the enemies of the Pope, but they mainly use it against evil spirits and heretics, disgusting to the religion of light.
As a sign of their position, the cardinals hold cruciform daggers - copies of the Sword of Yatuk, now the main symbol of faith and state."

    description=_"The Ogre Pope is the highest clergy title in the Ogre religion. It is on His behalf that the policy of the church is carried out - the spread of the teachings, the construction of temples, the announcement of the crusades. His power rivals that of the secular ruler, the King of Ogres. On the one hand, this confrontation weakens the integrity of the state, on the other hand, it prevents the petty tyrants to come in full power on both sides.
The staff of the Pope is the heaviest club of all the clergy. With its help, the head of the church crushes the skulls of heretics and schismatics, the lists of which are usually fixed on the club itself.
In addition to that, the Ogre Pope holds the main relic of the Ogre Kingdom – the sword of Yatuk, the Founding King, who adopted the faith of light and kindled the first spark in his soul with his sword. The lower ranks like the cardinals are only entitled to a smaller copy in the form of a dagger."
