The heads of the chosen ones are flayed to the bare skull, the wool receives a reddish hue from the blood that they drain out with their gaze and absorb into their bodies. With huge bone clubs at the ready, the chosen ones serve as a symbol of the power that the Bull God gifts to his faithful followers, and strike terror into ogres whose sympathies are on the side of shamansâ€¦"
