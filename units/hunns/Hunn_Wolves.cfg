    description= _ "Fear Shadows are the lesser steppe undead, evil spirits that are born out of human fear and take the form of wolves. During the day they hide in the steppe wind, and at night they gather in packs and hunt down lone travelers, caravan camps, or nomads. Shadows swirl around the prey, sparkling with ominous eyes and letting out a prolonged howl akin to that of the wind. As soon as the victim shows a sign of fear, the shadows immediately attack and devour them for a long time, slowly, because their true source of nourisment is not bones and meat, but the horror that prey experiences before death. Tales about the fear shadows are found in the legends of all the peoples of the Great Steppe, and over the centuries nomads have learned to resist them with the help of magic and amulets or courage, so death from a pack of shadows became a rare occurrence. However, in recent years, the shadows have become much more numerous, and they themselves have grown bolder, and began to pounce even on those who previously would have been considered too strong prey; This is due to the Hunn witches, who subjugated these undead beastd, bred them from the horror of tortured captives and put them at their service. Shadows are their main scouts in the steppe, and if in the dark you saw a pack of burning eyes, then you should know that you are watched not only by an evil spirit, but also forces that are much more powerful."
