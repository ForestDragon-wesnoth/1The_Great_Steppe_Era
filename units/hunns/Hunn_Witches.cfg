    description= _ "The Chernavas are the lowest-ranking witches in the Coven's hierarchy, girls who were born from human women and demons. They grew up within the walls of the city-coven, and since childhood they knew nothing but black magic and matrons who taught them their purpose. And the purpose of the chervanas is such: to learn witchcraft, and to give birth to a Kanavar warrior. Until this is done, the blacks are essentially the house slaves of the matrons who raise them. However, after childbirth and a test of power, they receive the recognition of the queen, personal freedom and the right to participate in the matters of the coven. Their responsibilities are to develop their witchcraft skills and help matrons in housekeeping. If a chernava is able to neither give birth nor use magic, an unenviable fate awaits her: the girl is sacrificed, and her blood is used to communicate with dark forces and various rituals. True, such cases are rather an exception to the rule. Most chernavas pass the test successfully. They are a guarantee of the future strength of the coven, for each generation of chernavas gives both talented witches and squads of half-blood warriors."

The first witches of the circle were the chernavas, raised personally by the queen, but now all capable dark matrons have this opportunity too. The responsibilities of the circle include discussing important issues with the queen, the government of the city (as a rule, each grand witch has her own region), the trial of witches (and only over them, the canovars and slaves are judged by the demons-knyazes) and the organization of the army of the undead before a campaign. The grand witches feed the skeletal hordes of ancient nomads, direct the mad priaml gods, send terrible curses upon the enemy's lands and, finally, and envelop the army in a magical fog so that it cannot be noticed from afar. The Grand Witches themselves rarely participate in the battle, but even from these indirect actions, it becomes clear to anyone who encounters the army of the coven which powerful sorcereresses are behind it.

    description= _ "This is the Witch Queen herself, the self-proclaimed mistress of the Dead Field and all the dark forces. In the northern lands, there is such a legend about its origin:

“A long time ago, a strong tsar ruled in the tsardom of Krad. His people prospered, and the neighboring lands recognized his strength and swore vassal oaths to him. All except the Temsk principality on the seashore, which remained independent. And the Knyaz of Temsk had a daughter of unprecedented beauty, whom people came to see from all over the world. And the tsar of Krad planned to marry her - get a beautiful wife, and inherit the principality while at it. He sent matchmakers three times - but all three times the proud princess refused his request. The tsar became absolutely furious, gathered a strong army, and marched to the Temsk. He ravaged the country, burned down the capital city, and kidnapped the princess right in front of her father, who turned gray and became speechless. The knyaz himself was sent to prison, Temsj was annexed to the kingdom of Krad, and the princess, even before the wedding, from the very night when the capital of Temsk fell, suffered. She gave birth to a daughter to the tsar, but tragically died during childbirth.
The tsar doted on his daughter, brought her gifts from overseas, boasted about her in front of foreign ambassadors, thinking about which prince to marry his daughter to.

Unbeknownst to him, his daughter got a horn from her mother. Should she blow the horn, before her would appear a Demon, and will do what the princess says, be it bringing something, playing games, or just chatting.

And the tsar of Krad from three queens had three sons, his pride and support.
One day the eldest son goes to the garden, and he sees his step sister playing checkers with a winged demon. He got scared and ran to the guard to call.
And the princess said coldly to the demon:
- Kill him.
He drew his sword and killed the elder prince before he had the time to warn anyone.
The princess blew the horn again - her demon disappeared into thin air, and she ran to her father to cry.
- They murdered, - she said, - my half-brother, your elder son, evil men in the garden; just barely I broke free from them. The tsar was angry, ordered to look for the assassins. He suspected the lords, and executed thirty-three of them. The people began to fear and mistrust the tsar.

Another time, the tsar's middle son was walking in the garden, he saw that his step sister was playing checkers with the winged demon.
He drew his sword and ran to the demon with a battle cry.
- Kill him - said the princess.
And the demon slain the second price as swiftly as he did the first.
The princess blew into the horn - and the demon disappeared.
She ran to her father in tears.
-Again -, she said -, evil people entered the garden, attacked me and your middle son! He just barely managed to protect me, bravely fought them with his sword, and now lies dead there ...
The tsar was furious and ordered to look for the assassins. He suspected the nobles again, and executed three hundred and three of them.
The people became angry with the way the king spilled their blood.
Another time the youngest son was walking in the garden, he saw the princess playing checkers with the demon.
Unlike the other two, he calmly approached, and sat down next to them.
- I know -, he says, -that you killed my brothers with your devil, sister. Yet that's exact what I need; I want to become king after my father, but with the older brothers alive that would not have been possible. Let's kill our father together, and rule the Krad kingdom ourselves.
The princess agreed, sent the demon to her father's bedroom, and the demon stabbed the tsar to death.
- Alas, you, my cunning brother, will not thrive, - said the princess. The demon appeared and stabbed the younger prince, and he himself took on his appearance.
There was a commotion in the palace when the servants of the slain king saw his lifeless body. The impostor prince summoned the entire courtyard, all the standard-bearers and vassals to the throne room, and made the follwoing speech:
- My father, our tsar, like my brothers, was killed by evil people. Since the most evil lords and the most evil nobles were already executed, the common people are guilty of the murder of our tsar!
They crowned the devil-prince to the kingdom, and the soldiers went out, and on the orders of the impostor they began to catch and cut down the common people, saying: This is what you get for murdering the tsar!
And the princess laughed, watching from the walls of the palace as the soldiers slaughtered innocent people.
The common people were brimming with fierce hatred. They took axes and stakes, overwhelemed the royal soldiers and nobles. The enraged crowd fought their way to the palace itself, and took it - they rushed into the throne room to bring the self-proclaimed bastard of a Tsar to justice.
And then tsar suddenly turned back into a devil, snapped his fingers, and summoned a horse with black wings; flew out on horseback from the hall and took the princess with him.

The demon flew away with the princess far into the steppe, they began to live there, and breed Kanavars. And their children went on campaigns to other kingdoms, taking many a prisoner with them.'"

    description= _ "The magical cults of the northern lands are divided into two types: cults that worship the light gods, and those that worship the spirits of the dark world. And while the former are supported by the princely power and are highly respected, a ban is imposed on the latter; worshipers of dark spirits are persecuted and punished by both the secular authorities and the priesthood. And no wonder - after all, a lot of evil was done by dark spirits in the old days! Most of all, the cults of the dark gods are popular among women. Sometimes, a girl is born seemingly with a fiend inside her, oddities happening to her, and no matter what people tried to do, there was no way to rid her of it. Such girls in the north are considered lunatics. They are feared and avoided. Many holy fools were formerly forced to flee to forests and swamps, and there, far from everyone, drag out their miserable existence as wild witches.

Now everything has changed.

The witch queen sent the messenger ravens to all the northern lands, to forests and swamps. She called these unfortunate girls to her place, and promised them support and protection. Many wild witches answered her call. The witch-queen discovered a great magical potential in them and took them under her personal tutelage. Local witches treat their wild sisters with apprehension, but this does not compare with the contempt they have for people from the northern land. The hearts of the wild witches are filled with hatred for people who rejected them and love for their patroness. Unbeknownst to the the people of the north, many of the misfortunes that have befallen them in recent decades - crop failures, epidemics, strife - are the work of the wild witches who have learned to draw strength from their hatred and direct it in what they view to be the right direction."
