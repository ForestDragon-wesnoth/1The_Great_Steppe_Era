The steppe ogre eat beef (as well as preparing it for later use) at the autumn festival dedicated to their Bull God, the ruler of the pastures of the underworld. Ogres traditionally make weapons, armor, and household items from the bones of bulls and other steppe animals.

The cult of the bull god is run by priests in horned masks - an order of sorcerers loyal to the Khan, and infinitely loyal to their god. These shamans are capable of sending heavy curses and turning bulls into monsterous minotaurs. Also, some ogres worship various spirits of nature - and by communing with spirits, shamans who control nature since ancient times have been at odds with the bull priests. The rest of the ogres treat both these groups with a mix of respect and superstitious fear.\n"

In the 'khan-led' hordes, the rulers from the sacred dynasty perform a primarily ritual role, and the main burden of management lies with the centurions - wise military leaders, subordinate to the khans, who judge, lead the nomads along the steppe routes, and organize raids. The centurions are assisted by the foremen, who in turn command small detachments of grunts. Each grunt in the horde is a warrior, head of a family, and owner of several bulls. The higher up the social ladder an ogre is, the larger his herd. The most numerous, of course, are the herds of the Khan himself, from which he feeds himself, as well as his squad of so-called "

"Desert nagas are, a serpentine people living in the desert south of the Great Steppe, and distant relatives of the aquatic naga. Unlike their western counterparts, desert nagas have smoother, more muscular bodies and yellowish scales. They practically do not know how to swim, and act poorly in the water, but they move well on the sand and are excellent diggers. Their dwellings are deep holes in the sand, fortified with clay, with a small round hut around the entrance, also made of clay. Desert nagas did not have a developed culture and lived in small settlements, which were ruled by the head of the clan - the chieftain. They did not engage in agriculture, and instead preferred hunting and robbery. Before the arrival of the serpentheads, desert nagas loved to ambush trade routes. They buried themselves in the sand, and then suddenly attacked the caravans, jumping out of the sand, then using primitive clubs and various weapons captured in battle. Goods plundered by the nagas was rarely used effectively. More often than not, they simply put the best things in their burrows and used the weapons for future raids. Among themselves, as well as with other peoples, the desert nagas rarely ever traded, except in exceptional cases, when the looted goods had to be sacrificed in order to acquire things necessary for survival of the tride, or to buy off stronger conquerors.\n"

"The arrival of the Serpentheads turned the once primitive desert barbarians into the elite of the new slave state. Finding some physical similarity, the powerful serpentheads chose the nagas as the first race with which they would subdue the rest. In an instant, the dunes of desert nagas were filled by hordes of Nuckelavee led by four-armed creatures similar to them. The serpentheads declared themselves a race of gods to the naga, and invited them to take part in their divine plan, the purpose of which being to create the so-called Serpent Khaganate and conquer all other peoples for the snake race. Many of the nagas happily accepted new masters - they would later become generals and bodyguards of the serpentheads - but some refused. The villages of the latter were brutally slaughtered and their children forced to become servants. Now their descendants perform various engineering work in the Khaganate, such as digging ditches and pit traps. Thus, Serpent Kaganate appeared.\n"
"\n"
"Under the rule of serpentheads, desert nagas have evolved significantly. They received literacy, their new owners taught them various knowledge, both in domestic and military affairs. The naga have become something of an aristocracy. In the course of the following conquests, even the lowest of them acquired their own slaves, and the higher ranking ones outright got whole palaces, and the right to feast at the same table with the serpentheads themselves. The current generation of naga are very proud of their position, and will defend the Khagan's power to the last."

"Gnolls are a race of hyenas walking on two legs from iron-rich hills of Gravr. In ancient times they were a bunch of savage tribes of hunters and fishermen who lived in poor shacks in a hilly savannah of their region and who, just as nagas, practiced pillage. While nagas pillaged the trading routes which go through the desert between human cities, gnolls prefered marching on the cities themselves. From obedient cities they received tribute (which included humans whom gnolls ate), those triying to retain independence were besieged and stormed. More than one oasis was captured and pillaged by swarms of hyena-headed savages, many once flourished settlements were erased from existence and never rose again and piles of half-gnawed skeletons left in their ruins... But something hindered gnolls - it's their lack of unity. Tribes speaking at least three dozen different languages were too proud to unite with anybody - because for uniting you need a common chief. For gnolls to acknoledge a member of another tribe as a chief means to diminish dignity of their own tribe, which they deemed unacceptable. They thought that gnolls of other tribes deserve only being eaten. All of this was exploited by humans cities, they pitted formidable savages against each other reducing their numbers and strength. As for relations with other races, gnolls always considered themselves superior to others and would never obey outsiders; even as mercenaries they had a reputation of the least reliable of all. At any moment a gnoll could turn his bone flail-trap and his claws against a former ally... That was believed until the time when fluttering banners of the Snake Khanagate appeared in Gravr with the roar of elephant's tusks trumpets.\n"
"\n"
"The lands of Gravr were gifted by the khagan to old naga nobility; by his highest will bekhs of the hissing with their assembled troops of vassal nagas enhanced by nukelavees and serpenthead representatives of the khagan entered gnolls' hills and immediately started building fortresses there. Gnolls respond to this as it's an invasion and tried to repel the invaders. Militias of hyena-headed ones were lashing the outsiders, with wrathful howl chiefs challenged enemy commanders to a duel. Bekhs laughed at this from their palanquins and, usually even without interrupting the building process, threw nukelavees in combat trampling walking savages and making them flee...\n"
"\n"
"However not all gnolls were annoyed by the invasion of the outsiders. A decent number of chiefs (usually those whose lands weren't affected by building of the Khaganate's fortresses, also those who were firsthand enemies of a tribe attacked by snakes) sent their embassies to, as one of them described, "

"Vampires are bloodsucking sentient undead found all over Irdya. Steppe or, as they're also called, Eastern vampires differ a bit from their Western brethren. The key trait of the Steppe Vampire is transformation: during daylight they look like ordinary people, at night they take their true form and look like skinny dry deceased with toothy maws and burning eyes. In any of these forms the Eastern vampire is faster and stronger than an ordinary human, though in comparison with the Western vampire the Eastern one is likely to be a bit weaker. But when it comes to dark sorcery and cunning the Steppe Vampires advanced a lot further than any other undead. They possess dozens of spells with shadows, illusions and even blood; their communities inflitrated human kingdoms of the South so deep that at some point Steppe vampires just manipulated them with the ease Western vampires could only dream of.\n"
"\n"
"Just as a lot of vampires of the West, Eastern vampires live in clans. They despise lone vampires and try to either recruit or destroy them. The residence of a clan may be inside ruins of some fortress, in a cave, in a royal court, it even may be a nomadic settlement somewhere deep in the desert. Before the arrival of Serpentheads four great vampire clans divided the human lands among themselves and controlled their fates through saboteurs inside nobility. The invasion of gnolls and nagas under the command of new mysterious creatures was met by vampires with hatred; vampires weren't going to surrender their power to aliens and gathered resources for the confrontation against new enemies. But, one after another, human cities were turned to ashes. Serpentheads discovered vampires among their nobility, examined them and seeing them as a threat started a real undead hunt. Vampires who got used to undisputed domination proved themselves unprepared to a gruelling magical struggle. Two of the four great clans were eliminated. Rumour was that their leaders were scorched by the black snake fire, which they couldn't get rid of with neither with water nor magic. The heads of the third clan decided that an open confronation against Serpentheads is too dangerous and they fled to inaccecible mountains to the South. The fourth clan, named "

"Serpentheads have a human torso, a serpent head and a tail. They have two pairs of hands, their intelligence is sharp and accurate, and their hyptonic influence makes creatures of other species obey them.\n"
"A powerful magical aura allows serpentheads to use the black flame, a fire that burns everything. The black flame is used both in industry and in combat.\n"
"But the main weapon of serpentheads is their organization. The order, known as the Serpent Khaganate, never knew any internal unrest or coup. In just three hundred years its territory expanded from a point far in the mountains to the whole South of the continent. For a serpenthead the strict hierarchy is more natural than daily sunrise and sunset."

It's unknown how Temsk princes established a contact with these demons, but later one of these Ka'Ruuk'Onis bound to a princess with a magical horn would play an important role in the history of the Greate Steppe and would give to her an idea to create the Dead Field Coven. From him the princess would learn secrets of black magic, secrets that other witches could only dream of. With him she would give birth to the first kanovars who would start the cycle of generations. With blood of killed victims more and more Ka'Ruuk'Onis infiltrate the terrestrial world. In the past centuries the number of demons increased up to several hundreds and the number of kanovar warriors under their command increased to several thousands. The emergence of the Dead Field Coven starts looking more and more like a plan with the demons behind it. And it seems that soon this plan will enter its active (and bloodiest!) phase."

However, after childbirth and a test of power, they receive the recognition of the queen, personal freedom and the right to participate in the matters of the coven. Their responsibilities are to develop their witchcraft skills and help matrons in housekeeping. If a chernava is able to neither give birth nor use magic, an unenviable fate awaits her: the girl is sacrificed, and her blood is used to communicate with dark forces and various rituals. True, such cases are rather an exception to the rule. Most chernavas pass the test successfully.

"This is the Witch Queen herself, the self-proclaimed mistress of the Dead Field and all the dark forces. In the northern lands, there is such a legend about its origin:\n"
"\n"
"“A long time ago, a strong tsar ruled in the tsardom of Krad. His people prospered, and the neighboring lands recognized his strength and swore vassal oaths to him. All except the Temsk principality on the seashore, which remained independent. And the Knyaz of Temsk had a daughter of unprecedented beauty, whom people came to see from all over the world. And the tsar of Krad planned to marry her - get a beautiful wife, and inherit the principality while at it. He sent matchmakers three times - but all three times the proud princess refused his request. The tsar became absolutely furious, gathered a strong army, and marched to the Temsk. He ravaged the country, burned down the capital city, and kidnapped the princess right in front of her father, who turned gray and became speechless. The knyaz himself was sent to prison, Temsj was annexed to the kingdom of Krad, and the princess, even before the wedding, from the very night when the capital of Temsk fell, suffered. She gave birth to a daughter to the tsar, but tragically died during childbirth.\n"
"The tsar doted on his daughter, brought her gifts from overseas, boasted about her in front of foreign ambassadors, thinking about which prince to marry his daughter to.\n"
"\n"
"Unbeknownst to him, his daughter got a horn from her mother. Should she blow the horn, before her would appear a Demon, and will do what the princess says, be it bringing something, playing games, or just chatting.\n"
"\n"
"And the tsar of Krad from three queens had three sons, his pride and support.\n"
"One day the eldest son goes to the garden, and he sees his step sister playing checkers with a winged demon. He got scared and ran to the guard to call.\n"
"And the princess said coldly to the demon:\n"
"- Kill him.\n"
"He drew his sword and killed the elder prince before he had the time to warn anyone.\n"
"The princess blew the horn again - her demon disappeared into thin air, and she ran to her father to cry.\n"
"- They murdered, - she said, - my half-brother, your elder son, evil men in the garden; just barely I broke free from them. The tsar was angry, ordered to look for the assassins. He suspected the lords, and executed thirty-three of them. The people began to fear and mistrust the tsar.\n"
"\n"
"Another time, the tsar's middle son was walking in the garden, he saw that his step sister was playing checkers with the winged demon.\n"
"He drew his sword and ran to the demon with a battle cry.\n"
"- Kill him - said the princess.\n"
"And the demon slain the second price as swiftly as he did the first.\n"
"The princess blew into the horn - and the demon disappeared.\n"
"She ran to her father in tears.\n"
"-Again -, she said -, evil people entered the garden, attacked me and your middle son! He just barely managed to protect me, bravely fought them with his sword, and now lies dead there ...\n"
"The tsar was furious and ordered to look for the assassins. He suspected the nobles again, and executed three hundred and three of them.\n"
"The people became angry with the way the king spilled their blood.\n"
"Another time the youngest son was walking in the garden, he saw the princess playing checkers with the demon.\n"
"Unlike the other two, he calmly approached, and sat down next to them.\n"
"- I know -, he says, -that you killed my brothers with your devil, sister. Yet that's exact what I need; I want to become king after my father, but with the older brothers alive that would not have been possible. Let's kill our father together, and rule the Krad kingdom ourselves.\n"
"The princess agreed, sent the demon to her father's bedroom, and the demon stabbed the tsar to death.\n"
"- Alas, you, my cunning brother, will not thrive, - said the princess. The demon appeared and stabbed the younger prince, and he himself took on his appearance.\n"
"There was a commotion in the palace when the servants of the slain king saw his lifeless body. The impostor prince summoned the entire courtyard, all the standard-bearers and vassals to the throne room, and made the follwoing speech:\n"
"- My father, our tsar, like my brothers, was killed by evil people. Since the most evil lords and the most evil nobles were already executed, the common people are guilty of the murder of our tsar!\n"
"They crowned the devil-prince to the kingdom, and the soldiers went out, and on the orders of the impostor they began to catch and cut down the common people, saying: This is what you get for murdering the tsar!\n"
"And the princess laughed, watching from the walls of the palace as the soldiers slaughtered innocent people.\n"
"The common people were brimming with fierce hatred. They took axes and stakes, overwhelemed the royal soldiers and nobles. The enraged crowd fought their way to the palace itself, and took it - they rushed into the throne room to bring the self-proclaimed bastard of a Tsar to justice.\n"
"And then tsar suddenly turned back into a devil, snapped his fingers, and summoned a horse with black wings; flew out on horseback from the hall and took the princess with him.\n"
"\n"
"The demon flew away with the princess far into the steppe, they began to live there, and breed Kanavars. And their children went on campaigns to other kingdoms, taking many a prisoner with them.'"

"The magical cults of the northern lands are divided into two types: cults that worship the light gods, and those that worship the spirits of the dark world. And while the former are supported by the princely power and are highly respected, a ban is imposed on the latter; worshipers of dark spirits are persecuted and punished by both the secular authorities and the priesthood. And no wonder - after all, a lot of evil was done by dark spirits in the old days! Most of all, the cults of the dark gods are popular among women. Sometimes, a girl is born seemingly with a fiend inside her, oddities happening to her, and no matter what people tried to do, there was no way to rid her of it. Such girls in the north are considered lunatics. They are feared and avoided. Many holy fools were formerly forced to flee to forests and swamps, and there, far from everyone, drag out their miserable existence as wild witches.\n"
"\n"
"Now everything has changed.\n"

"The witch queen sent the messenger ravens to all the northern lands, to forests and swamps. She called these unfortunate girls to her place, and promised them support and protection. Many wild witches answered her call. The witch-queen discovered a great magical potential in them and took them under her personal tutelage. Local witches treat their wild sisters with apprehension, but this does not compare with the contempt they have for people from the northern land. The hearts of the wild witches are filled with hatred for people who rejected them and love for their patroness. Unbeknownst to the the people of the north, many of the misfortunes that have befallen them in recent decades - crop failures, epidemics, strife - are the work of the wild witches who have learned to draw strength from their hatred and direct it in what they view to be the right direction."

As soon as the victim shows a sign of fear, the shadows immediately attack and devour them for a long time, slowly, because their true source of nourisment is not bones and meat, but the horror that prey experiences before death. Tales about the fear shadows are found in the legends of all the peoples of the Great Steppe, and over the centuries nomads have learned to resist them with the help of magic and amulets or courage, so death from a pack of shadows became a rare occurrence. However, in recent years, the shadows have become much more numerous, and they themselves have grown bolder, and began to pounce even on those who previously would have been considered too strong prey; This is due to the Hunn witches, who subjugated these undead beastd, bred them from the horror of tortured captives and put them at their service. Shadows are their main scouts in the steppe, and if in the dark you saw a pack of burning eyes, then you should know that you are watched not only by an evil spirit, but also forces that are much more powerful."

"Beklarbekh (which means 'bekh of all bekhs') is the hereditary position of the head of the Nagas. Once upon a time, the ancestors of the present Beklarbekhs were the first noble naga bloodline that swore allegiance to the Khagan of the serpentheads, and their oasis became a springboard for the troops of the newly-formed Khaganate. Now the beklarbekjs are dignitaries especially noted by the grace of the Khagan, who judge their fellow naga tribesmen, manage gigantic territories, and rally the ranks of the people under the Khagan's banner during wartime.\n"
"By his functions, a beklarbekh, also having to a large region and several regiments under him, is similar to a serpenthead tumenbashi, but in the hierarchy of the Khaganate is more of a 'younger brother' to them.\n"
"To distinguish himself as a leader in wartime is a good way for a beklarbekh to put his name on a par with his great ancestors and find favor in the eyes of the Khagan. At the same time, having very large physical dimensions and the highest-quality armor being comparable in cost to a whole small town, the bekhlarbekhs, as befits the hierarchs of the Khaganate leading into battle by their example, do not hesitate to break into the bloodiest fights. Destroying enemies with blows of their maces and absorbing their blows with their shield, the noble beklarbekh is not afraid of death - should he fall, the Khagan will find him a worthy replacement among the branched dynasty of the Khaganate's first vassals and loyal slaves."

Rarely the Shadow Master appears on a battlefield himself, but those who saw that event described him as a tall steppe dweller in an elegant chain mail, a helmet with a steel mustachioed mask and a black-as-night cloak. His movements are fast and accurate; in daytime he perfomed a bloody dance with two sabres shredding enemies to pieces, and at night he put off his helmet revealing his terrifying true face and unleashed a storm of blood magic on the unfortunate, making them literally explode from within or freeze like statues for ever. Having drunk enough blood, at dawn the Shadow Master put on his helmet again and looked mysterious and cautious. The battles he participated have never lasted more than one day and one night.\n"

msgid "Abomination are powerful monsters from the underworld. They were named so because no other word can truly describe these imposing and bloodthirsty creatures. The summoning of an Abomination is an monumental event for the steppe horde. To summon this beast, shamans shed rivers of blood, hundreds of bull bones fill a giant cauldron, and dozens of strong and furious ogres are sacrificed. All of this because the lord of the underworld himself is watching this: without the personal permission of the Bull God, the summoning will not work, so he needs to be offered generous gifts. As a result of bloody spells and terrible rituals, which can last for several days, from the black cauldron, which in such cases is called the Bloody Gate, a giant bone monstrosity with hungry burning eyes is born, which is soaked in blood, and which craves for more of the red liquid every second of its existence. As soon as possible, the Abomination is sent into battle. None of the sedentary peoples who met the Nightmare in battle could return and convey the horror it instills in their opponents. And the ogres themselves try to forget battles side-by-side with the Abomination, like a bad dream. Imagine for yourself: a giant bone beast rushes over the battlefield and collects a bloody harvest: under its piercing howl, like the howl of the wind in a hurricane, whole squads of friends and enemies alike fall to the ground at once, their blood boils, ruptures blood vessels and from under the skin flies in red streams into the ribs of the monster. And those who tried to stop the Nightmare in close combat are torn to pieces by huge claws or are crushed by its ominous skull. Where the Abomination flew by, a trail of dry and shriveled corpses and pieces of bodies remains, while not a drop of blood is left either in the dead or on the ground. Stopping such undead and sending them to another world after the war is as important an event as the summoning. Once again, rivers of blood, more sacrifices, sacrifices, and sacrifices, and all for the sake of the subterranean ruler personally taking his foul creation from this world. Throughout the history of the ogres, the Abominations have been called only a few times, but each of these calls is firmly imprinted in the memory of generations. So the ogres developed a fear of bull priests, and their neighbors have chilling legends about bloody demons from the depths of the steppes, which at any moment can wake up again and cause another apocalypse."

Сейчас поединщики — это смелые конные воины; обычно они действуют как средняя кавалерия, однако каждый из них всегда готов вспомнить добрую традицию и сразиться один на один в смертельной дуэли. Как правило, они служат на дальних заставах, где часто случается принимать такие дуэли."

Пусть они бедно вооружены, вековое соседство со степью сделало северян стойкими и храбрыми воинами, а регулярные военные сборы, которые князья организовывают в свободное от полевых работ время, прибавляют к их мужеству боевые навыки. Всякий противник, который принимал их за толпу необученных и слабых крестьян, быстро осознавал, как сильно он ошибся: стена из щитов этих суровых мужчин показала себя надёжным оружием и в нападении, и в защите родных земель.
