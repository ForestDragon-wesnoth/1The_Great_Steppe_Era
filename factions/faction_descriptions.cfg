"+_"<header>text='History'</header>
The concept of statehood in the east of the Continent begins with the Xian civilization. It was an ancient culture that arose before the eventual ascent of the Dunefolk and the migrations of the future Wesnothians. For a long time, the Xian civilization was just a mosaic of city-states and small kingdoms. Occasionally, someone would manage to gain the upper hand and become a hegemon; even so, the success did not last long – till the first royal coup, followed by the collapse of the entire Empire.

<header>text='The First Mandate'</header>
Everything changed when a huge black hole appeared out of nowhere, the voices from which instructed a local prince and prophesied great luck to those who would fulfill their will. The name of that abyss was Tartarus. Subsequently, this minor prince would conquer his neighbours and establish the first stable centralized power in the region. The Xian Mandate would be established. Although it would be able to defeat the Bull God's Centaur army in the future, Xian would have already become be too weak for later invasions.

<header>text='The Second Mandate'</header>
The next invasion came from inside – blue lizards – Kobolds, came to the surface from subterranean tunnels. Using the most modern siege engines, they quickly took the cities of Xian when they were at their weakest. Most humans were thrown into the Pit of Tartarus itself, a few escaped by fleeing to the distant lands. The Kobold Mandate reigned victorious. 

<header>text='The Third Mandate'</header>
The Kobolds would then be overthrown by the Jiangshi – energy vampires from the depths of Tartarus, who gained strength from the bodies of the Xians thrown into the Abyss and wanted more – the Mandate and blood of Kobolds. Then, they turned the lifeless Xians into their own Terracotta army.

<header>text='The Fourth Mandate'</header>
Vampires would not be in power for long. The new invaders – the subterranean giants known as the Mangus – would destroy the Jiangshi elite, subjugate the Terracotta People and earn the trust of Kobolds.Later, the Mangus will also go to meet the Yaoguai, offering them the status of clients of the Empire. From then on, the mysterious creatures would be basking in their acquired autonomy, supplying relatives to the service in exchange. The Fourth Empire was born – the strongest and most capable state, which had ever been honoured with the Mandate of the Abyss. However, there is still a going struggle among the Mangus clans for a place on the throne, resulting in disobedience and separatism. 

<header>text='Political and social structure'</header>
The Mangus are the elite of the state and the army, including the Emperor-Dahan. Jiangshi are bureaucrats and other government officers, Terracotta People are the army and police, Kobolds are artisans and scientists, the Yaoguai are mages and masters of silk and other arts. Kobolds and Terracotta People form the bulk of population, they are also engaged in agriculture and construction.The monstrous worms – Olgoi-Horhoi – are an indispensable tool in the arsenal of the Abyss Mandate. They are the ones who help to organize complex logistics to maintain a diverse and numerous army that can deliver pinpoint strikes on vulnerable enemy positions. 

<header>text='The Abyss of Tartarus'</header>
Tartarus appeared as the remains of the old Hierarchs, destroyed by the Bull God, strived to converge. Since then, Tartarus has been conspiring its own plans to maintain its presence in Irdia in order to destroy the Bull God and his minions in the future. It tests its own followers, calling for new applicants for the Mandate of Tartarus, weeding out any flaw and weakness of his creation."
