        description=_"Imagine the horror of the inhabitants of a small human town, which 400 years ago, for the first time in history, was raided by a horde of hitherto unknown cruel monsters. Savages twice the height of a man, riding chariots drawn by monstrous bulls, armed with bone axes and their furious screams echoing in the surroundings... That was the ogres.
That fateful day, mankind became acquainted with a new race of beings, which had eagerly joined the struggle for a place under the sun.

<header>text='Everyday Life'</header>

Ogres are a nomadic race. In the summer they graze huge herds of bulls, whom the ogres revere as sacred animals, in the steppes. They spend winters in the camps located in the semi-deserts of the far South. The cows give the ogres milk, which they drink, and from which they also make kumis, cheese, yogurt. The steppe ogre eat beef (as well as preparing it for later use) at the autumn festival dedicated to their Bull God, the ruler of the pastures of the underworld. Ogres traditionally make weapons, armor, and household items from the bones of bulls and other steppe animals. In addition to herding, ogres live by raiding settled lands, where they take prisoners to sell into slavery.

<header>text='Religion'</header>

Ogres worship the Bull God, who, according to their beliefs, rules the steppes of the underworld, where every ogre ends up after death, and is the direct ancestor of the holy dynasty of khans ruling almost all the hordes. The cult of the bull god is run by priests in horned masks - an order of sorcerers loyal to the Khan, and infinitely loyal to their god. These shamans are capable of sending heavy curses and turning bulls into monsterous minotaurs. Also, some ogres worship various spirits of nature - and by communing with spirits, shamans who control nature since ancient times have been at odds with the bull priests. The rest of the ogres treat both these groups with a mix of respect and superstitious fear.

<header>text='Social Structure'</header>

A horde of ogres - several tens or hundreds of nomadic families each, usually led by a khan from the sacred dynasty, occasionally a shaman; a horde has pastures and a winter town assigned to it. In the 'khan-led' hordes, the rulers from the sacred dynasty perform a primarily ritual role, and the main burden of management lies with the centurions - wise military leaders, subordinate to the khans, who judge, lead the nomads along the steppe routes, and organize raids. The centurions are assisted by the foremen, who in turn command small detachments of grunts. Each grunt in the horde is a warrior, head of a family, and owner of several bulls. The higher up the social ladder an ogre is, the larger his herd. The most numerous, of course, are the herds of the Khan himself, from which he feeds himself, as well as his squad of so-called "Butchers" - an unbridled part of the army that he personally maintains. These lunatics are too obsessed with killing to brother with grazing cattle, unlike the other grunts. Naturally, they are generally feared and hated by the other ogres.

Slavers are a somewhat unusual social class in the ogre society. They are considered by grunts to be 'too smart' because of their trading activities, ogres who, even during raids, rarely participate in the act of storming cities and villages, preferring to enter them last to take prisoners.

The last major social layer in the horde is the of shamans, whom most ogres fear as creatures possessing incomprehensible powers. The shamans are divided into two groups - the bull priests, who are close to the khan, and spirit shamans (naturalists) who are not close to anyone, and dislike the other ogres about as much as the other ogres dislike them. It is the latter who sometimes seize power in small hordes, reducing ordinary ogres to the status of slaves.
Students of shamans are arguably the most miserable creatures of the horde: not only do they have to follow a very difficult path of training before choosing joining either the bull priests of nature shamans, but they are also quite despised by all other ogres.

<header>text='Military'</header>

Mobile, preferring to end military conflicts with quick and devastating attacks, ogres take full advantage of their remarkable physical strength, magic and chariots.

        plural_name=_"race^Desert Nagas"
        description=_"Desert nagas are, a serpentine people living in the desert south of the Great Steppe, and distant relatives of the aquatic naga. Unlike their western counterparts, desert nagas have smoother, more muscular bodies and yellowish scales. They practically do not know how to swim, and act poorly in the water, but they move well on the sand and are excellent diggers. Their dwellings are deep holes in the sand, fortified with clay, with a small round hut around the entrance, also made of clay. Desert nagas did not have a developed culture and lived in small settlements, which were ruled by the head of the clan - the chieftain. They did not engage in agriculture, and instead preferred hunting and robbery. Before the arrival of the serpentheads, desert nagas loved to ambush trade routes. They buried themselves in the sand, and then suddenly attacked the caravans, jumping out of the sand, then using primitive clubs and various weapons captured in battle. Goods plundered by the nagas was rarely used effectively. More often than not, they simply put the best things in their burrows and used the weapons for future raids. Among themselves, as well as with other peoples, the desert nagas rarely ever traded, except in exceptional cases, when the looted goods had to be sacrificed in order to acquire things necessary for survival of the tride, or to buy off stronger conquerors.

The arrival of the Serpentheads turned the once primitive desert barbarians into the elite of the new slave state. Finding some physical similarity, the powerful serpentheads chose the nagas as the first race with which they would subdue the rest. In an instant, the dunes of desert nagas were filled by hordes of Nuckelavee led by four-armed creatures similar to them. The serpentheads declared themselves a race of gods to the naga, and invited them to take part in their divine plan, the purpose of which being to create the so-called Serpent Khaganate and conquer all other peoples for the snake race. Many of the nagas happily accepted new masters - they would later become generals and bodyguards of the serpentheads - but some refused. The villages of the latter were brutally slaughtered and their children forced to become servants. Now their descendants perform various engineering work in the Khaganate, such as digging ditches and pit traps. Thus, Serpent Kaganate appeared.

Under the rule of serpentheads, desert nagas have evolved significantly. They received literacy, their new owners taught them various knowledge, both in domestic and military affairs. The naga have become something of an aristocracy. In the course of the following conquests, even the lowest of them acquired their own slaves, and the higher ranking ones outright got whole palaces, and the right to feast at the same table with the serpentheads themselves. The current generation of naga are very proud of their position, and will defend the Khagan's power to the last."

        male_name=_"race^Gnoll"
        female_name=_"race+female^Gnoll"
        plural_name=_"race^Gnolls"
        description=_"Gnolls are a race of hyenas walking on two legs from iron-rich hills of Gravr. In ancient times they were a bunch of savage tribes of hunters and fishermen who lived in poor shacks in a hilly savannah of their region and who, just as nagas, practiced pillage. While nagas pillaged the trading routes which go through the desert between human cities, gnolls prefered marching on the cities themselves. From obedient cities they received tribute (which included humans whom gnolls ate), those triying to retain independence were besieged and stormed. More than one oasis was captured and pillaged by swarms of hyena-headed savages, many once flourished settlements were erased from existence and never rose again and piles of half-gnawed skeletons left in their ruins... But something hindered gnolls - it's their lack of unity. Tribes speaking at least three dozen different languages were too proud to unite with anybody - because for uniting you need a common chief. For gnolls to acknoledge a member of another tribe as a chief means to diminish dignity of their own tribe, which they deemed unacceptable. They thought that gnolls of other tribes deserve only being eaten. All of this was exploited by humans cities, they pitted formidable savages against each other reducing their numbers and strength. As for relations with other races, gnolls always considered themselves superior to others and would never obey outsiders; even as mercenaries they had a reputation of the least reliable of all. At any moment a gnoll could turn his bone flail-trap and his claws against a former ally... That was believed until the time when fluttering banners of the Snake Khanagate appeared in Gravr with the roar of elephant's tusks trumpets.

The lands of Gravr were gifted by the khagan to old naga nobility; by his highest will bekhs of the hissing with their assembled troops of vassal nagas enhanced by nukelavees and serpenthead representatives of the khagan entered gnolls' hills and immediately started building fortresses there. Gnolls respond to this as it's an invasion and tried to repel the invaders. Militias of hyena-headed ones were lashing the outsiders, with wrathful howl chiefs challenged enemy commanders to a duel. Bekhs laughed at this from their palanquins and, usually even without interrupting the building process, threw nukelavees in combat trampling walking savages and making them flee...

However not all gnolls were annoyed by the invasion of the outsiders. A decent number of chiefs (usually those whose lands weren't affected by building of the Khaganate's fortresses, also those who were firsthand enemies of a tribe attacked by snakes) sent their embassies to, as one of them described, "wonderfully brave" foreigners. Any embassy of gnollish tribes that didn't declare war but came to learn why foreigners came here were greeted by naga bekhs. They explained to barbarians that they bring peace, not sword. They showed to Gnoll's ambassadors the artifacts, Earth Compasses, which are able to find iron ore veins and expressed hopes of mutually benefical cooperation. Those of chiefs who agreed to cooperate benefited a lot: they provided workers for iron mines, in return gaining access to iron and then steel weapons. Employed to protect fortresses from their more principled kinsmen they adopted naga's battle formations which helped them a lot.

The more active were constructing of fortresses, iron mining and steel smelting, the hotter was the war in Gravr. Three out of twelve new naga fortresses were razed and their ashes were trampled by clawed feet of ferocious barbarians. After that the Khagan beklarbekhed one of his nobles in the country, elevated him over other bekhs, making the defence of the gnollish  periphery more organized. A lot of gnollish chiefs came to the court of the beklarbekh and became more and more involved in the strcuture of the newly emerging state. And after ten years from the the beginning of the Khaganate expansion the last resisting savage chief was killed and all gnolls became subjects of the Serpenthead's power as warriors, miners, officers and even farmers: Serpentheads taught them farming and cattle breeding, discovered suitable animals and crops, and gnollish farmers started to build and expand their farms. With the end of the unification the new decree of the Khagan turned tribal militias into one united mercenary army led by a beklarbekh, they were paid from the state's treasury. In the new army loyal and valiant warriors were to gain promotions and with them more money and power.

Shining legions of many thousands hyena-headed walked under the command of gnollish officers the streets of cities of the new country: yesterday's savages with sharp mind quickly adoped discipline, money, the notion of career and even patriotism becoming more and more civilised. The dreadful clawed hand of the Khagan became more and more visible. And then neighbours who witnessed all of this with awe started to panic. The human cities sent theambassadors to the capital of the Khaganate with the only question 'Why does the Khagan need all this troops near their borders?' The Khagan replied 'Obey, and you won't learn why they are needed'. Such news inspired the rise of pride of the human cities which formed the alliance to defend themselves from the unfriendly neighbour. Serpentheads claimed this to be an alliance to attack the Khagante, mobilised all the vassals of Naga's princes and started an invasion against human cities. All of them fell just in a couple of years. The human population was enslaved, passionaries eradicated and the banner of the bloody snake occupation flew over the whole South...

It was the first campaign of the gnoll legions of the Khagan, and they showed themselves great. Now their steel flail-traps are directed, by the will of the Khagan, towards the North, for the new lands, for the glory and promotions, for the spoils of war... And for enjoyable feasts with bodies of killed enemies. After all - for the wise Khagan, as for a true gnoll these days He is the First after God!"

        plural_name=_"race^Vampire"
        description=_"Vampires are bloodsucking sentient undead found all over Irdya. Steppe or, as they're also called, Eastern vampires differ a bit from their Western brethren. The key trait of the Steppe Vampire is transformation: during daylight they look like ordinary people, at night they take their true form and look like skinny dry deceased with toothy maws and burning eyes. In any of these forms the Eastern vampire is faster and stronger than an ordinary human, though in comparison with the Western vampire the Eastern one is likely to be a bit weaker. But when it comes to dark sorcery and cunning the Steppe Vampires advanced a lot further than any other undead. They possess dozens of spells with shadows, illusions and even blood; their communities inflitrated human kingdoms of the South so deep that at some point Steppe vampires just manipulated them with the ease Western vampires could only dream of.

Just as a lot of vampires of the West, Eastern vampires live in clans. They despise lone vampires and try to either recruit or destroy them. The residence of a clan may be inside ruins of some fortress, in a cave, in a royal court, it even may be a nomadic settlement somewhere deep in the desert. Before the arrival of Serpentheads four great vampire clans divided the human lands among themselves and controlled their fates through saboteurs inside nobility. The invasion of gnolls and nagas under the command of new mysterious creatures was met by vampires with hatred; vampires weren't going to surrender their power to aliens and gathered resources for the confrontation against new enemies. But, one after another, human cities were turned to ashes. Serpentheads discovered vampires among their nobility, examined them and seeing them as a threat started a real undead hunt. Vampires who got used to undisputed domination proved themselves unprepared to a gruelling magical struggle. Two of the four great clans were eliminated. Rumour was that their leaders were scorched by the black snake fire, which they couldn't get rid of with neither with water nor magic. The heads of the third clan decided that an open confronation against Serpentheads is too dangerous and they fled to inaccecible mountains to the South. The fourth clan, named "Grey Dawn" among vampires, found new opportunities in Serpenthead's might. Formerly vampires of the "Grey Dawn" lived in the Steppe and controlled the trading routes as well as perhipheral areas of all great human kingdoms, now they wanted to become the principal vampire force of the whole South. To achive that, the leaders of the "Grey Dawn" turned to the Serpenthead Khagan and offered him their service. The Khagan decided that vampires may become useful allies and made a treaty with them. The "Grey Dawn" moved their residence into the capital of the Khaganate and pledged to support the rule of Serpentheads over all Southern lands and to fight other vampires who occasionally annoyed with their sabotages. In return the Khagan disclosed several magical secrets to them and gave numerous gifts including a plethora of human slaves.

Nowadays the "Grey Dawn" serves the great Khagan. Its vampires are eyes, ears and an invisible hand of the serpents' rule. They act as spies and assassins in peacetime and as an elite detachment of mobile battle mages in times of war."

But the main weapon of serpentheads is their organization. The order, known as the Serpent Khaganate, never knew any internal unrest or coup. In just three hundred years its territory expanded from a point far in the mountains to the whole South of the continent.

It's unknown how Temsk princes established a contact with these demons, but later one of these Ka'Ruuk'Onis bound to a princess with a magical horn would play an important role in the history of the Greate Steppe and would give to her an idea to create the Dead Field Coven.

With blood of killed victims more and more Ka'Ruuk'Onis infiltrate the terrestrial world.

Kobolds organize themselves in clans, concentrated near generous ore and mineral deposits and underground lakes. In such conditions – with the necessity to make new tunnels and defend their caves from outsiders – the blue lizards have developed the technology of rapid-fire crossbows and chemical explosives.
It is not known for sure whether Kobolds knew about the Great Abyss before or whether they gathered within its vicinity only when Tartarus called for new candidates for the Mandate. But when the Empire of Xian was suffering a state crisis, the blue lizards rapidly consolidated their clans in a desire to acquire the benefits from a doomed civilization. Showering the squares of the cities with arrows and breaking through the walls with mining equipment, they destroyed the Empire of Xian in the shortest possible time. As a sign of their triumph, they seized inhabitants indiscriminately – the living and the dead – and threw them into the hopeless blackness of the Great Abyss.
Although the Kobolds could not hold their power for a long time – having later experienced the onslaught of the Jiangshi who emerged from the Abyss with an army of Terracotta Warriors – the resurrected Xians – they were able to survive the harsh times and remain an important part of the state under the Mandate of Mangus.

<header>text='Origins'</header>

Mangus were not known in Irdia before their taking of The Mandate. Either they dwelled too deep to meet any other creatures, or they were a recent creation, possibly by Tartarus itself. In any way, Mangus have proven to be successful in the current situation – overthrowing dysfunctional Jiangshi, preserving all the previous ruling races and integrating them into a working society and making an alliance with frivolous yet powerful Yaoguai. As of now, there is no obvious reason for Mangus to lose the favor of the Mandate.

<header>text='Life'</header>

young Mangus appear from depths of Tartarus regularly, but their memory is often blurry as on how they came to life and what they saw deep below. As such, all Mangus consider Tartarus their father and call all other Mangus siblings or brothers. Such friendly addresses although do not prevent Mangus from harsh competition which often results in duels and blood sport. However, despite their brutish appearance, they are usually smart enough to avoid such feuds during war. 
Unlike other races, Mangus do not seem to suffer weaknesses of old age – they do not become senile and fragile, and only get stronger and bigger with years. At a certain point, an old Mangus would decide to make the Great Descent – to go down the Pit of Tartarus, trying to reach the place of their birth. Although this experience is as hazy as their memory of their actual birth, they return somewhat “endarkened” – what Mangus say as opposed to “enlightened”. “Endarkened” Mangus are even stronger and larger than regular brutes, as well as possessing up to three heads or faces. They earn the name of Yelbeghen – “demonic dragon”. They are the elite of Mangus and occupy the highest positions of the Mandate’s society. They still take great pleasure in combat – it would be a great misuse of their new power – usually leaving the most mundane and boring governing work to tireless and incorruptible Jiangshi.

<header>text='Mangus and Worms'</header>

Mangus’ life is strongly linked with one of a Worm. Although Mangus are current holders of the Mandate, they probably would not have achieved such heights without the help of Worms. This relationship cannot be equated to owner-pet, as no Mangus has direct control over a particular Worm and vice-versa, their relationship is mutual and equal. 
Such strong link is understandable, as underground life of such giants as Mangus is barely imaginable, yet Worms provide great help burrowing tunnels for their close friends."

They may seem like mindless monsters, but there is more to the story. There is some intelligence, a hidden mind slumbering in that enormous mass of dagger-like teeth and foul flesh. Other creatures may not fully understand it, but they feel a Worm’s presence, they feel its pressing will – as if Tartarus whispers through its children.
Wherever there is a Worm, there is also a mangus. Although such an alliance seems at first glance unobvious, it would be difficult for a great-in-size mangus to survive in an underground environment without the help of overgrown burrowing worms. This connection manifests itself in the almost sacred respect from Mangus to the Worms, which can only be overshadowed by their fanaticism for the Great Abyss. Mangus bow and greet worms much like their own kinsmen and celebrate their attainment of old age.

At the same time, worms are by no means pets of mangus, they are independent of them and are not in anyone's keeping. This relationship can be compared to that one of drakes and lizards, although in the case of mangus and worms, this it has truly reached the level of symbiosis."

        description=_"Yaoguai are magical beings of a dualistic nature. They exist between life and death, wild and civilized, loyal and treacherous. Many dwell in isolated mountains, forests and swamps of the Tartarus Mandate. Although Yaogai serve the State during war and peace alike, their homelands enjoy significant autonomy: they are allowed self-governance without imperial supervision, and outsiders are strictly forbidden from entering the territory of Yaoguai. Thus, the life of these beings is covered in a veil of secrecy even to most whom they ally themselves with.

<header>text='Origins'</header>

The origin of Yaogai is solely based on speculation since the isolation of their communities. If Yaoguai descend from something, it is certainly not human. Although Yaogai like Vixens or Jorogumo have for the most part human-like appearance or traits, in their habits and intelligence they diverge extremely from away from them, especially when peace is no option.
The most likely assumption is that the Yaogai are the result of special rites by ancient cults and wizards, who perfected and improved their familiars, trying to figure out a way of achieving godhood. But with the familiars gaining becoming more power than their masters, they needed their lordship no more. 

<header>text='History'</header>

Since the existence of Yaoguai, they have caused terror to anyone who dared to come close to their lands. Such hostile and protective behavior was especially evident in their interactions with Xian. Although open conflicts were not uncommon, Yaoguai preferred other means of terrorizing their enemies. They often kidnapped children or seduced men for later manipulations or murders. This caused Xian society to be extremely paranoid, and also creative in making wild stories and speculations on Yaoguai.
During the First Mandate, The Mandate of Xian, tensions were especially high. As the unified empire tried to push back the Yaoguai, the creatures stayed low. But in rare moments when they did confront Xian, they were as destructive and violent as never seen before, after which they stayed low again.
Similar situation was established between Yaoguai and Kobolds, who were interested in hunting down Yaoguai for sport. It ended tragically for Kobolds when Yaoguai organized a devastating counter-attack, leaving the blue reptiles vulnerable to incoming forces of Jiangshi and Terracota Warriors. 
During the reign of Jiangshi, the relations between the empire and Yaoguai seemed surprisingly neutral, even non-existent. Yet, Jiangshi were very likely to know of Yaoguai presence. 
Mangus, who came into power after Jiangshi, seemed unaware of Yaoguai at first. However, they soon reached several Yaogui communities with an offering – Yaoguai would become clients of the Mandate, serving their skills to the Empire, while their lands and secrets remain protected. The deal, which seemed suspiciously in favor of Yaoguai, eventually gained its ground. As those tribes accepted the deal and soon learned the benefits of such cooperation, they were offered a second condition to prove their loyalty – they reach out other Yaoguai communities personally and offer them the same deal with the Mandate. Either they accept it, or die by the claws of their own kin. 
In the end, Yaoguai proved their alliance with the Mandate and remain crucial to the life of the Empire.

<header>text='Types'</header>

There are several types of known Yaoguai:
Vixens – are humanoid-like creatures with fox traits – most noticeably – ears and tails, though their limbs also possess likeness to those of foxes. They are most potent in magic among Yaoguai.
Like Vixens, Jorogumo also possess animal and humanoid features, though to a more obvious degree – as their spider bodies have significant size compare to their human halves. 
Although Jiangshi do not live together with Yaoguai, their innate magical abilities and essence are similar, which may suggest their common origin."
