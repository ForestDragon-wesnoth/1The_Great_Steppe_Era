        description=_"Imagine the horror of the inhabitants of a small human town, which 400 years ago, for the first time in history, was raided by a horde of hitherto unknown cruel monsters. Savages twice the height of a man, riding chariots drawn by monstrous bulls, armed with bone axes and their furious screams echoing in the surroundings... That was the ogres.
That fateful day, mankind became acquainted with a new race of beings, which had eagerly joined the struggle for a place under the sun.

<header>text='Everyday Life'</header>

Ogres are a nomadic race. In the summer they graze huge herds of bulls, whom the ogres revere as sacred animals, in the steppes. They spend winters in the camps located in the semi-deserts of the far South. The cows give the ogres milk, which they drink, and from which they also make kumis, cheese, yogurt. The steppe ogre eat beef (as well as preparing it for later use) at the autumn festival dedicated to their Bull God, the ruler of the pastures of the underworld. Ogres traditionally make weapons, armor, and household items from the bones of bulls and other steppe animals. In addition to herding, ogres live by raiding settled lands, where they take prisoners to sell into slavery.

<header>text='Religion'</header>

Ogres worship the Bull God, who, according to their beliefs, rules the steppes of the underworld, where every ogre ends up after death, and is the direct ancestor of the holy dynasty of khans ruling almost all the hordes. The cult of the bull god is run by priests in horned masks - an order of sorcerers loyal to the Khan, and infinitely loyal to their god. These shamans are capable of sending heavy curses and turning bulls into monsterous minotaurs. Also, some ogres worship various spirits of nature - and by communing with spirits, shamans who control nature since ancient times have been at odds with the bull priests. The rest of the ogres treat both these groups with a mix of respect and superstitious fear.

<header>text='Social Structure'</header>

A horde of ogres - several tens or hundreds of nomadic families each, usually led by a khan from the sacred dynasty, occasionally a shaman; a horde has pastures and a winter town assigned to it. In the 'khan-led' hordes, the rulers from the sacred dynasty perform a primarily ritual role, and the main burden of management lies with the centurions - wise military leaders, subordinate to the khans, who judge, lead the nomads along the steppe routes, and organize raids. The centurions are assisted by the foremen, who in turn command small detachments of grunts. Each grunt in the horde is a warrior, head of a family, and owner of several bulls. The higher up the social ladder an ogre is, the larger his herd. The most numerous, of course, are the herds of the Khan himself, from which he feeds himself, as well as his squad of so-called "Butchers" - an unbridled part of the army that he personally maintains. These lunatics are too obsessed with killing to brother with grazing cattle, unlike the other grunts. Naturally, they are generally feared and hated by the other ogres.

Slavers are a somewhat unusual social class in the ogre society. They are considered by grunts to be 'too smart' because of their trading activities, ogres who, even during raids, rarely participate in the act of storming cities and villages, preferring to enter them last to take prisoners.

The last major social layer in the horde is the of shamans, whom most ogres fear as creatures possessing incomprehensible powers. The shamans are divided into two groups - the bull priests, who are close to the khan, and spirit shamans (naturalists) who are not close to anyone, and dislike the other ogres about as much as the other ogres dislike them. It is the latter who sometimes seize power in small hordes, reducing ordinary ogres to the status of slaves.
Students of shamans are arguably the most miserable creatures of the horde: not only do they have to follow a very difficult path of training before choosing joining either the bull priests of nature shamans, but they are also quite despised by all other ogres.

<header>text='Military'</header>

Mobile, preferring to end military conflicts with quick and devastating attacks, ogres take full advantage of their remarkable physical strength, magic and chariots.

        description=_"Desert nagas are, a serpentine people living in the desert south of the Great Steppe, and distant relatives of the aquatic naga. Unlike their western counterparts, desert nagas have smoother, more muscular bodies and yellowish scales. They practically do not know how to swim, and act poorly in the water, but they move well on the sand and are excellent diggers. Their dwellings are deep holes in the sand, fortified with clay, with a small round hut around the entrance, also made of clay. Desert nagas did not have a developed culture and lived in small settlements, which were ruled by the head of the clan - the chieftain. They did not engage in agriculture, and instead preferred hunting and robbery. Before the arrival of the serpentheads, desert nagas loved to ambush trade routes. They buried themselves in the sand, and then suddenly attacked the caravans, jumping out of the sand, then using primitive clubs and various weapons captured in battle. Goods plundered by the nagas was rarely used effectively. More often than not, they simply put the best things in their burrows and used the weapons for future raids. Among themselves, as well as with other peoples, the desert nagas rarely ever traded, except in exceptional cases, when the looted goods had to be sacrificed in order to acquire things necessary for survival of the tride, or to buy off stronger conquerors.

The arrival of the Serpentheads turned the once primitive desert barbarians into the elite of the new slave state. Finding some physical similarity, the powerful serpentheads chose the nagas as the first race with which they would subdue the rest. In an instant, the dunes of desert nagas were filled by hordes of Nuckelavee led by four-armed creatures similar to them. The serpentheads declared themselves a race of gods to the naga, and invited them to take part in their divine plan, the purpose of which being to create the so-called Serpent Khaganate and conquer all other peoples for the snake race. Many of the nagas happily accepted new masters - they would later become generals and bodyguards of the serpentheads - but some refused. The villages of the latter were brutally slaughtered and their children forced to become servants. Now their descendants perform various engineering work in the Khaganate, such as digging ditches and pit traps. Thus, Serpent Kaganate appeared.

Under the rule of serpentheads, desert nagas have evolved significantly. They received literacy, their new owners taught them various knowledge, both in domestic and military affairs. The naga have become something of an aristocracy. In the course of the following conquests, even the lowest of them acquired their own slaves, and the higher ranking ones outright got whole palaces, and the right to feast at the same table with the serpentheads themselves. The current generation of naga are very proud of their position, and will defend the Khagan's power to the last."

        id=steppegnoll
        male_name=_"race^Gnoll"
        female_name=_"race+female^Gnoll"
        plural_name=_"race^Gnolls"
        description=_"Gnolls are a race of hyenas walking on two legs from iron-rich hills of Gravr. In ancient times they were a bunch of savage tribes of hunters and fishermen who lived in poor shacks in a hilly savannah of their region and who, just as nagas, practiced pillage. While nagas pillaged the trading routes which go through the desert between human cities, gnolls prefered marching on the cities themselves. From obedient cities they received tribute (which included humans whom gnolls ate), those triying to retain independence were besieged and stormed. More than one oasis was captured and pillaged by swarms of hyena-headed savages, many once flourished settlements were erased from existence and never rose again and piles of half-gnawed skeletons left in their ruins... But something hindered gnolls - it's their lack of unity. Tribes speaking at least three dozen different languages were too proud to unite with anybody - because for uniting you need a common chief. For gnolls to acknoledge a member of another tribe as a chief means to diminish dignity of their own tribe, which they deemed unacceptable. They thought that gnolls of other tribes deserve only being eaten. All of this was exploited by humans cities, they pitted formidable savages against each other reducing their numbers and strength. As for relations with other races, gnolls always considered themselves superior to others and would never obey outsiders; even as mercenaries they had a reputation of the least reliable of all. At any moment a gnoll could turn his bone flail-trap and his claws against a former ally... That was believed until the time when fluttering banners of the Snake Khanagate appeared in Gravr with the roar of elephant's tusks trumpets.

The lands of Gravr were gifted by the khagan to old naga nobility; by his highest will bekhs of the hissing with their assembled troops of vassal nagas enhanced by nukelavees and serpenthead representatives of the khagan entered gnolls' hills and immediately started building fortresses there. Gnolls respond to this as it's an invasion and tried to repel the invaders. Militias of hyena-headed ones were lashing the outsiders, with wrathful howl chiefs challenged enemy commanders to a duel. Bekhs laughed at this from their palanquins and, usually even without interrupting the building process, threw nukelavees in combat trampling walking savages and making them flee...

However not all gnolls were annoyed by the invasion of the outsiders. A decent number of chiefs (usually those whose lands weren't affected by building of the Khaganate's fortresses, also those who were firsthand enemies of a tribe attacked by snakes) sent their embassies to, as one of them described, "wonderfully brave" foreigners. Any embassy of gnollish tribes that didn't declare war but came to learn why foreigners came here were greeted by naga bekhs. They explained to barbarians that they bring peace, not sword. They showed to Gnoll's ambassadors the artifacts, Earth Compasses, which are able to find iron ore veins and expressed hopes of mutually benefical cooperation. Those of chiefs who agreed to cooperate benefited a lot: they provided workers for iron mines, in return gaining access to iron and then steel weapons. Employed to protect fortresses from their more principled kinsmen they adopted naga's battle formations which helped them a lot.

The more active were constructing of fortresses, iron mining and steel smelting, the hotter was the war in Gravr. Three out of twelve new naga fortresses were razed and their ashes were trampled by clawed feet of ferocious barbarians. After that the Khagan beklarbekhed one of his nobles in the country, elevated him over other bekhs, making the defence of the gnollish  periphery more organized. A lot of gnollish chiefs came to the court of the beklarbekh and became more and more involved in the strcuture of the newly emerging state. And after ten years from the the beginning of the Khaganate expansion the last resisting savage chief was killed and all gnolls became subjects of the Serpenthead's power as warriors, miners, officers and even farmers: Serpentheads taught them farming and cattle breeding, discovered suitable animals and crops, and gnollish farmers started to build and expand their farms. With the end of the unification the new decree of the Khagan turned tribal militias into one united mercenary army led by a beklarbekh, they were paid from the state's treasury. In the new army loyal and valiant warriors were to gain promotions and with them more money and power.

Shining legions of many thousands hyena-headed walked under the command of gnollish officers the streets of cities of the new country: yesterday's savages with sharp mind quickly adoped discipline, money, the notion of career and even patriotism becoming more and more civilised. The dreadful clawed hand of the Khagan became more and more visible. And then neighbours who witnessed all of this with awe started to panic. The human cities sent theambassadors to the capital of the Khaganate with the only question 'Why does the Khagan need all this troops near their borders?' The Khagan replied 'Obey, and you won't learn why they are needed'. Such news inspired the rise of pride of the human cities which formed the alliance to defend themselves from the unfriendly neighbour. Serpentheads claimed this to be an alliance to attack the Khagante, mobilised all the vassals of Naga's princes and started an invasion against human cities. All of them fell just in a couple of years. The human population was enslaved, passionaries eradicated and the banner of the bloody snake occupation flew over the whole South...

It was the first campaign of the gnoll legions of the Khagan, and they showed themselves great. Now their steel flail-traps are directed, by the will of the Khagan, towards the North, for the new lands, for the glory and promotions, for the spoils of war... And for enjoyable feasts with bodies of killed enemies. After all - for the wise Khagan, as for a true gnoll these days He is the First after God!"

        plural_name=_"race^Vampire"
        description=_"Vampires are bloodsucking sentient undead found all over Irdya. Steppe or, as they're also called, Eastern vampires differ a bit from their Western brethren. The key trait of the Steppe Vampire is transformation: during daylight they look like ordinary people, at night they take their true form and look like skinny dry deceased with toothy maws and burning eyes. In any of these forms the Eastern vampire is faster and stronger than an ordinary human, though in comparison with the Western vampire the Eastern one is likely to be a bit weaker. But when it comes to dark sorcery and cunning the Steppe Vampires advanced a lot further than any other undead. They possess dozens of spells with shadows, illusions and even blood; their communities inflitrated human kingdoms of the South so deep that at some point Steppe vampires just manipulated them with the ease Western vampires could only dream of.

Just as a lot of vampires of the West, Eastern vampires live in clans. They despise lone vampires and try to either recruit or destroy them. The residence of a clan may be inside ruins of some fortress, in a cave, in a royal court, it even may be a nomadic settlement somewhere deep in the desert. Before the arrival of Serpentheads four great vampire clans divided the human lands among themselves and controlled their fates through saboteurs inside nobility. The invasion of gnolls and nagas under the command of new mysterious creatures was met by vampires with hatred; vampires weren't going to surrender their power to aliens and gathered resources for the confrontation against new enemies. But, one after another, human cities were turned to ashes. Serpentheads discovered vampires among their nobility, examined them and seeing them as a threat started a real undead hunt. Vampires who got used to undisputed domination proved themselves unprepared to a gruelling magical struggle. Two of the four great clans were eliminated. Rumour was that their leaders were scorched by the black snake fire, which they couldn't get rid of with neither with water nor magic. The heads of the third clan decided that an open confronation against Serpentheads is too dangerous and they fled to inaccecible mountains to the South. The fourth clan, named "Grey Dawn" among vampires, found new opportunities in Serpenthead's might. Formerly vampires of the "Grey Dawn" lived in the Steppe and controlled the trading routes as well as perhipheral areas of all great human kingdoms, now they wanted to become the principal vampire force of the whole South. To achive that, the leaders of the "Grey Dawn" turned to the Serpenthead Khagan and offered him their service. The Khagan decided that vampires may become useful allies and made a treaty with them. The "Grey Dawn" moved their residence into the capital of the Khaganate and pledged to support the rule of Serpentheads over all Southern lands and to fight other vampires who occasionally annoyed with their sabotages. In return the Khagan disclosed several magical secrets to them and gave numerous gifts including a plethora of human slaves.

Nowadays the "Grey Dawn" serves the great Khagan. Its vampires are eyes, ears and an invisible hand of the serpents' rule. They act as spies and assassins in peacetime and as an elite detachment of mobile battle mages in times of war."

A powerful magical aura allows serpentheads to use the black flame, a fire that burns everything. The black flame is used both in industry and in combat.
But the main weapon of serpentheads is their organization. The order, known as the Serpent Khaganate, never knew any internal unrest or coup. In just three hundred years its territory expanded from a point far in the mountains to the whole South of the continent. For a serpenthead the strict hierarchy is more natural than daily sunrise and sunset."

It's unknown how Temsk princes established a contact with these demons, but later one of these Ka'Ruuk'Onis bound to a princess with a magical horn would play an important role in the history of the Greate Steppe and would give to her an idea to create the Dead Field Coven. From him the princess would learn secrets of black magic, secrets that other witches could only dream of. With him she would give birth to the first kanovars who would start the cycle of generations. With blood of killed victims more and more Ka'Ruuk'Onis infiltrate the terrestrial world.
